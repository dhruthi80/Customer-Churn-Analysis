# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors that contribute to customer attrition. By leveraging Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn. This analysis provides valuable insights that can help businesses improve customer retention strategies.
